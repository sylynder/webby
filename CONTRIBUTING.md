# Contributing to Webby

Webby is a community driven project and accepts contributions of code and documentation from the community. These contributions are made in the form of Issues or [Pull Requests](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) on the [sylynder/engine repository](https://github.com/sylynder/engine) on GitHub.

Issues are a quick way to point out a bug. If you find a bug or documentation error in Webby then please check a few things first:

1. There is not already an open Issue
2. The issue has already been fixed (check the develop branch, or look for closed Issues)
3. Is it something really obvious that you can fix yourself?

Reporting issues is helpful but an even better approach is to send a Pull Request, which is done by "Forking" the main repository and committing to your own copy. This will require you to use the version control system called Git.

### Branching

Looking at the nature of the Webby Framework, it has it's engine in a different Github repository [sylynder/engine](https://github.com/sylynder/engine)
And so all contributions will have to be focused on that repository. It has been hard to figure out how to allow contributors to add to the project. 

Currently Pull requests are to be sent to the develop branch of the Github repo [sylynder/engine](https://github.com/sylynder/engine)
which will be coming from your forked branch at your end.
