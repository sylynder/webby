## Documentation

The main documentation of Webby can be found here: [Webby Docs](https://webby.sylynder.com/docs)

The documentation is currently been updated constantly. It will take time to cover all aspects of the framework but we are working around the clock to make this possible. 

Currently we have planned to use the blogs section to guide developers through their journey in learning the framework.

If you have been developing with CodeIgniter3 already and you are familiar with the HMVC approach you can still use the same knowlegde to get going.

For developers who are very familiar with the CodeIgniter3 framework can still refer to the documentation here: [CI3 Docs](https://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/index.html)


## Server Requirements

PHP version 7.4 or newer is recommended.

PHP 8.1 was released in November 2021 and so most of it's functionalities were not known to be supported yet, this delayed the development of this project to work perfectly with the latest version 8.1 of PHP and the framework, we advise to stay between versions 7.4 and 8.0 for stable PHP appplication development. 

If you want to discover bugs and contribute, then you are welcome to use the PHP 8.1 version. 


## FAQs

#### Why did you decide to create Webby
---
Webby was created with PHP beginners in mind. Looking at how other frameworks makes it difficult for beginners to start.

#### Is it anything different from CodeIgniter 3 or 4?
---
It uses the Core of the CodeIgniter3 framework and borrows some new features added from CodeIgniter 4. It is designed to move developers who are familiar with CI3 to easily to CI4.
