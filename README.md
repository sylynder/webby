## Documentation

The main documentation of Webby can be found here: [Webby Docs](https://webby.sylynder.com/docs)

A lot of documentation needs to be done, currently most features still works exactly as CodeIgniter3 does. This is for developers who are very familiar with the CodeIgniter3 framework and so you can refer to the documentation here: [CI3 Docs](https://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/index.html)


## Server Requirements

PHP version 7.4 or newer is recommended.

PHP 8.1 was recently released i.e. in November 2021 and so most of it's functionalities might not be discovered to work perfectly with the framework, we advise to stay between versions 7.4 and 8.0 for stable PHP appplication development. 

If you want to discover bugs and contribute, then you are welcome to use the PHP 8.1 version. 


## FAQs
